- Example fitsheader after ingestion/curation:
  Typical filename: 20150921_MD1_0002.fits


- director stucture outline examples:
  see also https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/repository-structure-and-python

- merge students work


- astrometry.net can perhaps be used to detect the constellations. 
  Since we will not be able to see a lot of stars, maybe it's easy to
  make a local copy of this software instead of relying on astrometry.net
